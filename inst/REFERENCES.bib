  abstract    = {The spawn index is one component of Pacific Herring (Clupea pallasii) stock assessments in British Columbia, Canada. This document describes how we calculate the spawn index from spawn survey observations (e.g., spatial extent, number of egg layers, substrate type). There are three types of spawn survey observations: (1) observations of spawn taken from the surface usually at low tide; (2) underwater observations of spawn on giant kelp, Macrocystis (Macrocystis pyrifera); and (3) underwater observations of spawn on other types of algae and the substrate, which we refer to as ‘understory.’ We calculate the spawn index in four steps. First, we develop a statistical framework and sampling protocol to estimate the number of eggs in a given area. Second, we develop a conversion factor to convert Pacific Herring eggs to biomass. Third, we calculate the spawn index for each spawn survey observation type: surface, Macrocystis, and understory. Finally, we add the spawn indices from the three types of survey observations, and aggregate by stock assessment region and year to produce a relative index of combined sex spawning biomass. We also provide an approach to calculate biomass for spawn-on-kelp fisheries. In addition, we identify uncertainties in calculations, suggest future research, and list caveats to using the spawn index. Last, we describe how users can install the SpawnIndex R package to calculate the spawn index. Although we transform the spawn survey data from egg density to biomass in tonnes, the resulting data is a relative index of spawning biomass.},
